 I like coding, I am good to it... But it is never good back. Oh well, I cant let that get to me. Oh i do webapps and backend algorithms. I think they call that fullstack or sum

 # JavaScript
 JavaScript is my best language, it is my goto if I am coding because of how fast a project can be made when you get good with it. I also like the simplicity of working with HTML/CSS and the exapndability it has 
 with ElectronJS and the ability to make desktop apps. I do fullstack development, meaning I make webapps that have a webapp, database, and in some cases, completely seperate computers that supply it with. I dont 
 have too much up on github, but there are some cool little webapps I made.

 I am very proud of my Limitless-TCP library that I built, I was getting annoyed with how many steps there were to setting up a tcp server and how annoying it was that there wasnt some kind of disconnection error if 
 you killed the other side, so I decided to make a library with built in hearbeats, found ways around any type of packet distortion, and even includes a built in chunking system, that future plans for it will 
 hopefully allow for the library to be usable in multiple languages, including C/C++, Python, C#, And Java.

 # Vue.JS - HTML/CSS
 Vue.JS is my main HTML framework, I choose vue because of the way it can be seemlessly integrated with vanilla CSS and HTML, this allows for me to have full control of a webpage and its styles via JavaScript while 
 still being able to use the responsive utilities of the framework. Using vue, I was able to throw together my pixel art webapp in about 1 hour.

 HTML and CSS are relatively easy languages to get used to. There will always be something to learn, but once you learn basic positioning and effects, you will be able to spend more time learning those little  
 things. But yes, HTML/CSS is one of my good skills.

 # Java
 Java is my first language, English is second. Lol thats the joke I like to make at least. Java was the first language that I ever learned, while I dont use it nearly as much as I used to, I still do a few projects 
 in it every now then. I mainly use it for discord bots and minecraft plugins. The reason I still use it for discord bots instead of using JavaScript is because I like the way the Java API is setup, and my coding 
 style makes the code much easier to navigate for me.

 # Databases
 Most of my database knowledge is with MySQL, I have gotten good at structuring databases in MySQL. I have worked with MongoDB in the past, I understand the structure and setup but I never really learned any of the 
 commands. I have maybe one project that I did for it with Minecraft a while ago.

 # Software
 I can code using any software really, heck, I've coded a webapp in notepad before. But I always prefer using Jetbrains products, I just like the ui design, color scheme, and their code interpreters are some of the 
 best in the game.
